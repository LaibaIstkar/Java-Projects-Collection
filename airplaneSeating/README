Airplane Seating Project
This Java project simulates an airplane seating arrangement and booking system. The program lets users select and book seats based on their preferences and availability.

Features
The seating arrangement consists of 7 rows and 5 columns, offering a total of 35 seats.
Seats are labeled with digits 1 to 7 and letters A to D.
Each seat can be either available or booked.
Users can choose and book available seats.
The program provides a graphical representation of the seating arrangement.
It prevents users from booking already booked seats.

How to Run
1- Compile the Java source code by executing the following command in your terminal:
javac Main.java

2- Run the compiled program:
java Main

3- Follow the on-screen prompts to select and book seats.

Usage
