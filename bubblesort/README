Bubble Sort and Searching Algorithms - Java
This Java program demonstrates the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers and provides options for searching using binary and linear search algorithms.

Overview
The Bubble Sort and Searching Algorithms program performs the following tasks:

Accepts a list of integers from the user.
Uses the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the integers.
Allows the user to search for a specific integer using binary or linear search.

Features
Bubble Sort: Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.
Binary Search: Enables searching for a specific integer using the binary search algorithm.
Linear Search: Provides the option to search for an integer using the linear search algorithm.

How to Run
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your Java development environment.
Compile and run the bubblesort class to start the program.

Usage
The program prompts you to enter integer values separated by spaces.
Invalid inputs are handled, and valid inputs are stored in an ArrayList.
The program displays the original list of integers.
The Bubble Sort algorithm is applied to sort the integers.
The sorted list of integers is displayed.
You can enter a value to search for its index position in the array.
Choose whether to use binary search or linear search for searching.
The program displays the index position of the searched value or an error message.
